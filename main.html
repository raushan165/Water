          <h1 style="color:snow;">WATER AVAILABILITY</h1>
          <p>Water availability is a fundamental cornerstone of life on Earth, intricately intertwined with the health of ecosystems, human well-being, and economic development. As our planet faces increasing pressures from climate change, population growth, and urbanization, ensuring reliable access to clean water has become a paramount challenge. From sustaining agriculture to supporting industries and meeting the needs of growing urban populations, the availability and quality of water resources are pivotal for a sustainable future. This crucial resource underpins not only environmental sustainability but also social equity and economic prosperity.</p>

          <h3><a class=land href="">ASIA</a></h3>
          <p>28%<br>Asia is home to more than half of the world’s population and has less freshwater than any continent other than Antarctica. The water availability in Asia is measured at 3,920 cubic meters per person per year. Asia has approximately 28 percent of the world’s total freshwater resources.</p>

          <p>45%<br>Water availability in America varies widely due to regional differences and issues. Some regions have ample freshwater resources from rivers and aquifers, while others face challenges such as drought, pollution, and overuse. Sustainable management practices are essential to address these issues and ensure reliable water access for communities, agriculture, and industry while protecting the environment.</p>

          <p>15.8<br>Water availability in Europe varies across the continent. Generally, Northern and Western Europe have abundant freshwater resources, including rivers, lakes, and groundwater. However, Southern Europe faces challenges such as water scarcity due to arid climates and increasing demand. Sustainable water management practices, including conservation, infrastructure development, and cross-border cooperation, are crucial to ensure sufficient water supply for all European countries.</p>

          <p>90%<br>Antarctica holds about 70% of the world's freshwater, mainly in the form of ice. However, accessing this water is challenging due to the continent's harsh climate and remote location. Limited liquid water exists in lakes and streams, but overall, Antarctic water resources are difficult to utilize for practical purposes.</p>

          <p>Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the collection and storage of rain, rather than allowing it to run off. Rainwater is collected from a roof like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation, so that it seeps down and restores the ground water.</p>
